# IMMEDIATE INTEGRATION:
print("""
üö® IMMEDIATE FIX FOR YOUR CURRENT TRAINING:

1. Stop your current training (Ctrl+C)

2. Edit your optimized_model_trainer.py:
   
   # Find your exchange initialization and replace with:
   exchange = create_safe_exchange()
   
   # Find your data fetching and replace with:
   data = safe_fetch_with_delays(exchange, symbol, timeframe)

3. Restart training:
   python optimized_model_trainer.py --full-train --enhanced

Expected result:
‚ùå No more "Too many requests" errors
‚úÖ 3-5 second delays between requests
‚úÖ Training completes successfully
